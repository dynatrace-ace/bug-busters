# Bug Busters Bug Finding Expedition ðŸ“‹

Your mission in this bug finding expedition is to find bugs in the following two applications which are setup to run inside a local Kind Kubernetes cluster:

- To-Do App
- BugZapper Asteroids Style Game

As part of the journey, you'll utilize Dynatraces Live Debugger and other capabilities to find where the bugs are occuring in the codebase.

Dynatrace's Observability for Developers allows you to:

- Debug running applications in any environment
- Gain instant insights into debug level data to diagnose problems
- Get full visibility into code and code execution
- Instantly debug complex workflows
